# AnnotSV: An integrated tool for Structural Variations annotation and ranking

## QUICK INSTALLATION

1. The sources can be cloned to any directory:

```
cd /path/to/install/
git clone git@github.com:lgmgeo/AnnotSV.git
```

2. Then, the user can easily install the package using make:

```
cd /path/to/install/AnnotSV
make PREFIX=. install
make PREFIX=. install-human-annotation
make PREFIX=. install-mouse-annotation
```

3. Set the global environmental variable as the location of the git repo on your system.

In csh:

```
setenv ANNOTSV /path/to/install/AnnotSV/
```

In bash:

```
export ANNOTSV=/path/to/install/AnnotSV
```

## TEST

1. Change to the repo directory, and run the test

```
cd /path/to/install/AnnotSV/share/doc/AnnotSV/Example/
$ANNOTSV/bin/AnnotSV -SVinputFile test.bed -outputFile ./test.annotated.tsv -svtBEDcol 4
```

2. Examine the output

Happy exploring!

## COLLABORATIVE WORK

Anyone interested in implementing new annotations/features in AnnotSV?

Thanks to the [AnnotSV user community](https://lbgi.fr/AnnotSV/acknowledgments):

    - Bugs could be tackled efficiently

    - New ideas could be investigated faster

I look forward to the opportunity to work together,

feel free to fork the page if you want to help :-)

## Differences between pyAnnotSV and AnnotSV

- CLI parameters are prefixed with `--` instead of `-` _e.g.,,_ `--SVinputFile` instead of `-SVinputFile`
- All boolean CLI parameters now take 1/0 instead of yes/no, 1/0, or true/false
- The configfile included with AnnotSV is now required. Providing a user defined configfile is still optional
